<p>This is a <strong>delicious</strong> homestyle creamy chciken recipe!</p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<p><ul>
    <li> 6 chicken thighs</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons of olive oil</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons of butter</li>
    <li> 6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li> 1 small diced yellow onion</li>
    <li> 1/3 cup of chciken broth</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup of crispy bacon</li>
    <li> 1 3/4 cups of half and half</li>
    <li> 3 cups of baby spinach</li>
    <li> Salt and fresh cracked black pepper</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon of italian seasonings</li>
    <li> 1/2 cups of fresh parmesan cheese</li>
    <li> Crushed red chili flakes (optional) </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
<p><ol>
<li>To make the garlic butter chicken thighs with creamy spinach and bacon: 
    Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken thighs 
    on both sides with salt and pepper, and sear in the pan for 5-8 minutes on 
    each side, or until cooked through. Once cooked, remove chicken from the 
    pan and set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in the remaining cooking juices leftover in the pan. Add 
        in the onion and garlic and fry until fragrant (about one minute). Pour 
        in the chicken stock (or white wine, if using), and allow to reduce down 
        slightly. Add the crispy bacon and fry for 1-2 minutes to release the flavors.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low heat, add the half and half (or heavy cream), and bring 
        to a gentle simmer, while stirring occasionally. Make sure to lower the heat
        to avoid the sauce to separate. Add Italian seasoning and season with salt 
        and pepper to your taste.</li>

        pepper to your taste.</li>
    <li>Add in the spinach leaves and allow to wilt in the sauce, and add in the parmesan 
        cheese. Allow sauce to simmer for a further minute until cheese melts through the 
        sauce. For a thicker sauce, add the cornstarch mixture (1 teaspoon cornstarch + 1 
        tablespoon water, see the ingredients list) to the skillet, and continue to simmer 
        while quickly stirring the mixture through until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked chicken back into the pan; sprinkle with chili pepper flakes (if using),
         and spoon the sauce over each chicken thigh. Serve the Garlic Butter Chicken with 
         Spinach and Bacon over pasta, rice, or on its own. <strong> Enjoy!</strong></li>
